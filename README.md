This project presents an interactive **Banking Dashboard** that analyzes key financial metrics based on a banking dataset. It integrates **Python** for data processing and **Power BI** for dynamic visualization. The dashboard provides insights into **Deposits**, **Loans**, and an overall **Summary** of customer banking activities.

## 📌 Technologies Used

- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)** for data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- **Power BI** for data visualization
- **DAX and Power Query** for data modeling and transformations

## 💡 Key Insights
